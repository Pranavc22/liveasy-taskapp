# Liveasy-TaskApp

This is a prototype app made as a task for the Liveasy Internship.

## Introduction

Liveasy is building an online truck-booking platform. This mini-app, consisting of four main pages, is built for a similar purpose. It is part of a task for the Liveasy Internship. 
The app allows the user to select a language, sign in using their phone number and then select a profile. 

## Concepts Learned
This mini-app covered various topics from basic Material UI to working with the Firebase and Flutter frameworks. flutter_svg and pin_entry_text_field were two new flutter packages that I discovered through the app. 
This was also the first time I worked with the phone authentication service of Firebase. Some of the new concepts learned were: 
- Using vectors from Figma in Flutter apps in the form of .svg files.
- Different layout and UI patterns
- Firebase phone authentication system. The entire function and how it works. 
- Using asynchronous functions. 
- Passing values between two classes. 
- Using validation in the TextFormField widget. 
- Using the RadioListTile widget.
